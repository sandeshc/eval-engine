DONE 1. Drop down menu for users on login page (add fix: pressing up/down doesn't scroll the list)
DONE 2. Feature to reorder the search results to get the value of 'newrank'
DONE 3. Ensure in feature 2 that partially-relv docs always occour below relv docs
DONE 4. Write a python code to evalute Precision@K, DCG, nDCG for each (user, query) pair
DONE 5. Update the python code to evaluate scores as avg over all users for each query
DONE 6. Update description of LaSer and link to project on the index page
DONE 7. Update guidelines on how to evaluate the results for the users (eg. when is a result relevant?)
DONE 8. Update the thanks.php page, give break before image
9. Add a README.md

Note : 
(query, user) -> DCG = sum_over_i[1 to K]( rel_i [0,1,2] * f(newrank_i) [K - newrank_i + 1] / log(oldrank_i) )
(query) -> DCG = sum_over_i[1 to K]( avg_over_users(rel_i [0,1,2]) * avg_over_users(f(newrank_i) [K - newrank_i + 1]) / log(oldrank_i) )
