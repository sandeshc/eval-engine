1. Drop down menu for users on login page
2. Feature to reorder the search results to get the value of 'newrank'
3. Ensure in feature 2 that partially-relv docs always occour below relv docs
4. Write a python code to evalute Precision@K, DCG, nDCG for each (user, query) pair
5. Update the python code to evaluate scores as avg over all users for each query
6. Insert description of LaSer and link to project on the index page
7. Insert guidelines on how to evaluate the results for the users (eg. when is a result relevant?)

Note : 
(query, user) -> DCG = sum_over_i[1 to K]( rel_i [0,1,2] * f(newrank_i) [K - newrank_i + 1] / log(oldrank_i) )
(query) -> DCG = sum_over_i[1 to K]( avg_over_users(rel_i [0,1,2]) * avg_over_users(f(newrank_i) [K - newrank_i + 1]) / log(oldrank_i) )
